How to run our Steganography program:

-Hiding
Open and run the HideData java class, this will ask you in the terminal to input the name of the file with the extention that you want to use as the cover image, and then the payload.
E.G our test cover image is "stegg.bmp" and our test data is "payload.txt"
This will save a stego-object called "output.bmp"

-Extracting
Open and run the ExtractData java class, this will automatically take in the output.bmp file and return the payload calling it "extracted_data." whatever extention
